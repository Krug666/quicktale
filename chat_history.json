You want to create a multilingual application for a library of books with summaries, targeting both readers and writers. Here's a plan to get started:\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n*   **Reader Features:**\n    *   A home screen displaying book summaries (30-page previews).\n    *   Options to purchase individual books or subscribe for full access.\n    *   A personal library where users can add their own books in PDF format.\n*   **Writer Features (accessible upon authentication as a writer):**\n    *   Ability to add books to the main library for sale.\n    *   Interface to add summaries, translations, and audio tracks to their books.\n*   **Core Functionality:**\n    *   User authentication (readers and writers).\n    *   Book summary display with PDF, audio, and translation options.\n    *   Personal library for users to upload and manage their books.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: `#F5F5DC` (Beige)\n    *   Text: `#2E294E` (Dark Indigo)\n    *   TextSecondary: `#6E7191` (Grayish Blue)\n    *   Primary: `#6639A6` (Deep Purple)\n    *   Secondary: `#A772CB` (Lavender)\n    *   Accent: `#F0E68C` (Khaki)\n    *   Card: `#FFFFFF` (White)\n    *   Highlight: `#BDBDBD` (Gray)\n*   **Typography:**\n    *   Use modern and clean fonts like \"System\" for general text and headings.\n\n**Plan for Implementation:**\n\n1.  **Authentication:** Implement user authentication for both readers and writers.\n2.  **UI Structure:**\n    *   Create the basic UI structure with tabs for \"Home,\" \"Library,\" and \"Profile.\"\n    *   Implement the home screen to display book summaries.\n    *   Implement the library screen to display the user's personal books.\n    *   Implement the profile screen for user settings and writer options.\n3.  **Book Summary Display:**\n    *   Create a component to display book summaries with options for PDF, audio, and translations.\n4.  **Personal Library:**\n    *   Implement functionality for users to upload and manage their books in their personal library.\n5.  **Writer Features:**\n    *   Implement the writer interface for adding books to the main library, including summaries, translations, and audio tracks.\n\nNow, let's start with the code changes. I'll provide instructions for the coding agent to implement the plan and modify the app/(tabs) folder to implement the changes and make the changes visible for the user.\n\nAfter the coding agent implements the plan, please remove the `modalDemos` array from `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx`.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-10-06T13:12:15.643448"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you build this multilingual book library application!
